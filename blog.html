      I am a Software Engineer (DevOps, if that's a thing) living and working

      in London. I moved to the UK in 2010 from Eritrea where I was born and

      lived for ~ 2/3 of my life.  
     </p>
     <p> 
      In 2014 I graduated from the University of Westminster in Computer
Networks and Comms (more on that on my LinkedIn).       
   </p> 
    <p>
    Interested in Computers, troubleshooting from a young age, I have
formalised that interest by getting a degree in Computer Networks.

    Multilingual - English, <a target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigrinya_language">Tigrigna</a>, Italian and French.
    The last two I'm quite forgetting, shamefully. The plan is to practice
them, but in reality I'm losing them by the day.
    </p>

Lately I have been really interested in the philosophy of Stoicism. I find that
it answers many of the question that I come up about my life, emotions and the
world in general. I may write about this in the form of blogs or musings etc...
In the meantime I am reading one letter each morning from Seneca's letters to
Lucillium (Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium)[link to TF's ].

What's the plan with this website? Whilst in the lockdown I thought I could
teach myself web dev, something I've always postponed or was never as
interested. I've mostly if not entirely done backend development.
Voila' I decided to get a website and start developing. 
The plan is to keep improving this site as I go and learn more about HTML, CSS,
JS etc.
It is also my plan to do everything by hand, 'the hard way' etc. and keep this
site as minimalist as possible [like this https://mnmlist.com/about/ :D ].
