      <h2>Me in a nutshell</h2>
      <p>
        Software Engineer (DevOps) and tech enthusiast.
      </p>
      <p>
        I live and work in London. Born and lived in Eritrea for ~ 2/3
        of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a few years stint as a building surveyor after finishing high school.
      </p>
      <p>
        <del>Multilingual</del> - <a target="_self" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigrinya_language">Tigrigna</a>, English, Italian and French.
        Sadly, I'm forgetting the last two by the day.
      </p>
      <h2>Some more details?</h2>
      <p>
        More <a target="_self"  href="about">about me here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h2>Latest?</h2>

      </p>
      <h2>Why a website?</h2>
      <p>
        This is my corner of the [digital] world. A space I own, where I can
        freely express myself and have full ownership of the contents, without <a
        target="_self" href="https://xkcd.com/1150/">depending</a> on any
        third party or social media giant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason is that I had little to no interest in front-end or web development.
        During the lengthy lockdown, however, I thought I could make use of the time by
        learning something new. So, since I have always toyed with the idea of having my own
        website: here it is!
      </p>
      <p>
        Very basic, as are my current skills in HTML/CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I intend to keep it as minimalist as possible. This means not using
        any framework or library and hand-writing everything.
      </p>
