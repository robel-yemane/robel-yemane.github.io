The story you tell yourself

How does it sound? What are its contents? Is it one where every reason, every
excuse is pointed outwards to the world depriving you of any agency? Or is it
one where you are the main actor in your life, and you have the choice and
ability to shape the course of your life?

What that story looks like, matter a lot and you should know that it is a
reinforcing feedback loop. What you tell yourself you believe. What you believe
you actualise. What has been actualised meets the specs you designed thus
reinforcing your story and belief in it - making it a full circle.

Decide which story you want to believe - you have that freedom. Put up a filter
granular enough to filter in all or most of the elements of the reality your
story is based on.
Live your life that way. Your filter will feed you what you want to see, what
you want to believe and the feedback loop will kick in.

Concentrate on your responses. The world, reality, truth, simply IS. There is
no positive or negative quality to it. Your response, your story about the world
and the meaning you give to them is what your world consists of.

Your world is unique to you. Your response to [the world] events, the filters
you use and the story you tell makes it so. Beware to not go out and look for
victimising and paralysing stories. As long as you are alive and with full
health (?), the story is yours to invent and live. Tune your filter
accordingly.
