        (This is my <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">NOW</a> page)
      <p>
        It's been a long while since I updated this page.
        A lot has happened since my last update. The biggest and best of all being I now have a 10-month-old
        baby girl. As anyone who has a kid can attest, your life changes unrecognisably... to the good.
        It's a marvelous thing to happen to anyone and I am savouring it. Of course, it comes with its own challenges,
        but that's life!
        <p>
         So, I haven't had much of a routine in the past year, or better it looked very much like this:
         <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My old morning routine:<br><br>-Wake up early<br>-Meditate<br>-Stretch<br>-Drink green juice<br>-Journaling<br>-Set goals for the day<br><br>My new routine:<br><br>-Wake up very early<br>-Change baby&#39;s diaper<br>-Play with him<br>-Take the dog out<br>-Unload the dishwasher<br>-Put baby down for a nap</p>&mdash; Tiago Forte (@fortelabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1473023931107856385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

      <ul>
        <li>I am working at Currencycloud as a Platform Engineer.</li>
        <li>I haven't been reading with any regularity although I have tried to read whenever I had some time.
          So, the only books I am reading daily are
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29093292-the-daily-stoic">The Daily Stoic</a> and any of these
          <a href="https://usborne.com/gb/books/browse-by-category/novelty-books/touchy-feely-books">Touchy-feely books</a> for my daughter
          who enjoys them a lot.
