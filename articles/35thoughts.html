<h2>35 thoughts on my 35th birthday</h2>
<p id="date">2020.07.03</p>
<ul>
<li> Passion will follow your perseverance and constant improvement.</li>
<li> You will harm yourself by comparing yourself to others. Your true comparison is your
  old self.</li>
<li> Take the difficult route, the one you fear. A fear met is a fear
dispelled.</li>
<li> Picture yourself on your deathbed: what would your regrets be? You may have
  the chance to minimise those regrets.</li>
<li> Where you spend your attention is where you spend your life.</li>
<li> Master compounding. Small constant progress in your savings,
  health, knowledge.</li>
<li> You can't please or be liked by everyone.</li>
<li> Say no if you don't believe in it.</li>
<li> Lying or acting wrongfully corrupts the mind of its host.</li>
<li> Change, meaningful change comes from within.</li>
<li> Always write down your thoughts. Writing clarifies.</li>
<li> Learn to spend time alone with yourself. There is a lot yourself will
  tell you. Don't kill your gut feeling.</li>
<li> Give away more of your belongings. You need very little to lead a healthy
 life.</li>
<li> Create a gratitude journal. Fill it with few lines of what you are
grateful for on the day. The clean water you drink is not for granted.</li>
<li> Reduce your cynicism. Assume good intentions from others and attribute to
stupidity and ignorance any bad behaviour.</li>
<li> Master the basics. A complex structure stands on its
foundation.</li>
<li> Read to be informed, to be mentored by the greats out of your reach.</li>
<li> You have ample time now. Do more of doing and less of postponing.</li>
<li> Put practice ahead of theory and results ahead of conventional wisdom.</li>
<li> Meditate.</li>
<li> No one has figured out life. Do not despair, and do not stagnate. Keep
going.</li>
<li> Take up your cross and go on your path. Do not complain about life's
  obstacles. What blocks becomes the way.</li>
<li> Don't be attached to an identity. You live, learn and evolve.</li>
<li> Watch your habits and small actions. They add up to define you.</li>
<li> Awareness should underpin everything we do  and are.</li>
<li> Proving a point is overrated.</li>
<li> Eyes and mind are deceitful. Do not judge on assumptions. What you judge you
  cannot understand.</li>
<li> The hardest endeavour is to understand yourself.</li>
<li> Don't take shortcuts.</li>
<li> Learn and practice inversion.</li>
<li> What you think of yourself is much more to the point than what others think
  of you. Be honest with yourself. You are the easiest person to fool.</li>
<li> Awareness of your sins is your path to salvation and freedom.</li>
<li> Teach to learn.</li>
<li> No pain lasts long.</li>
<li> Prove your words by your deeds.</li>
