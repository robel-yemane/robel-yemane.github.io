    <h2>The Story you tell yourself</h2>
    <time datetime="2020-08-02">2020.08.02</time>

    <p>
     How does it sound? What are the contents? Is it one where every reason, every
     excuse points outwards to the world depriving you of any agency? Or, is it
     one where you are the main actor in your life, and you have the choice and
     ability to shape the course of your life?
    </p>
    <p>
     What that story looks like matters a lot. You should know that it is a
     reinforcing feedback loop. What you tell yourself you believe. What you believe
     you actualise. What has been actualised meets the specifications you designed
     reinforcing your story and your conviction in it - making it a full circle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Decide which story you want to believe - you have that freedom. Create a filter
     granular enough to filter in the elements of story is based on.
     Live your life that way. Your filter will feed you what you want to see, what
     you want to believe and the feedback loop will kick in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Concentrate on your responses. The world, reality, truth, simply IS. There is
     no positive or negative quality to it. Your response, your story about the world
     and the meaning you give to it is what your world consists of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your world is unique to you. Your response to events, the filters
     you use and the story you tell makes it so. Beware to not go out and look
     for victimising and paralysing stories. As long as you are alive and
     healthy, the story is yours to invent and live. Tune your filter
     accordingly.
