<p>
I'm a tech enthusiast and try to stay current with emerging tech. My job as
Software Engineer (DevOps) allows me to be involved mostly in infrastructure and
backend development.

<p>
In the last few years I have taken great interest in Stoicism, mainly through
the writings of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. I find it very practical,
action-oriented and a tool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance and
wisdom, rather than just being a field of academic inquiry.

I try to meditate and journal every day.
I also enjoy listening to podcasts but these days the number of
podcasts I am subscribed to is getting a bit out of hand.
I enjoy reading mainly books but also blogs. Some of them are <a
